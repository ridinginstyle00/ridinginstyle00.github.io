			<h1>The Corona</h1>
			<p>
				&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Yeah nobody want's to hear much about COVID-19. But, we're supposed to explain a good or happy thing that's happened because of it! My life has been about somewhat normal since COVID became a major deal. I stay at home most days, so nothing much changed. However with it happening over the summer, we've had time to hand-excavate and fix our pool we set up last year!
				<br>
				&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I would just like to preface this with, our land is the <font style="font-weight: bold">worst</font> to deal with. You can't dig without hitting a rock three times the size of your foot. We have a manufactured store bought pool. When we set it up last year and the swimming season had ended, a lot of the sandy ground around the pool had eroded. Instead of rebuilding the sandy hill the pool was sitting on, we decided to dig it into the ground instead. We ended up renting a machine for a day to dig a majority of the ground out. However, with no major machinary aside from that, it's taken a long time to chip everything away. In fact we are still currently working on it. We are in the endgame of smoothing and leveling out the ground it will sit on. After that, we just need to remove the surrounding piles of dirt and it will finally be finished several months later (while reaching the end of the swimming season).
