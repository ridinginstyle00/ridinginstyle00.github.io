			<h1>My Hobby</h1>
			<p>
				&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In my free time I do a lot of things on a technological device. However, the prompt was specific about a non-technology hobby. The main thing I do in my free time that doesn't require technology would be practicing guitar. I've been playing on and off for about two years now. I still haven't learned a song to play all the way through. I lose the motivation to play for an hour or so everyday. Instead I play every few days to keep my fingers in shape. It helps for when I do get in the mood to practice a lot again. 
				<br><br>
				&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I don't have much else that I do besides farm work. Guitar is really my only non-technical hobby out there right now. So this page is going to be a little empty.
