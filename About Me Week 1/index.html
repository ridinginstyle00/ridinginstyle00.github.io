			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hello class! Ignore any mess that may be here. It's been some time since I've had to crack open some HTML files. My name is Quinn Ridings, and this is the start of my third year here at OTC. I'm going for a degree in Computer Science. More specfically, my plan is to be a computer programmer. For the readers out there that are knowledgable in this field, I'm thinking I will major in the Java language. 
				<br><br>
				&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I don't have a family of my own just yet, but I do have a young pup named Sky.&ensp;As far as I currently know she's a mutt. I only got her about three to four months ago and she's been an amazing dog.
