This site was not created off of a template. It includes a very light grey'ish background and four images total.
The image swapping javascript changed from the last version to more match the book as told. 
	This is different from the last one, but does pass arguments through the function to conserve space.
The double click event does use an if/else statement to swap between the same 8 photos.
NOTE: Images will be a little slow to load, I used a royalty free images website where the images were a very high quality.
