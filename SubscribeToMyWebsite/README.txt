Website template used: 
	https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/checkout/?paymentMethod=on

The background image came from a royalty free images site located here:

Many parts were removed, I only used this for the CSS included and it was a Bootstrap template, which was suggested.
The 'checkout' Bootstrap template that I used was primarily a white'ish color all around. I opted to use a background image to add some color behind the form.
Due to how the template downloaded, there may still be some areas that need indentation fixed. 
	I tried my best to go through and make the code readable while I used it. :)
