This page is based off of the original Cheech's Pizza site I had submitted.
Validation was created to ensure the user inputted the correct items in the correct fields
	or followed formatting required.
The only external code that was introduced not part of this chapter was the toFixed() function.
	I only used this for graphical changes on the site to make the costs in numerical format.
The thank you page is modified from the original one provided.
The printQuery() function was moved to a new javascript file named: submit-script.js.
Here I called printQuery and another function, as well as saved variables.
