                Welcome to the site. This is where I will house all of my HTML projects I have made for either my own gain or for classes.

                Each button, when clicked, will expand and show a short description of that site. Inside of the description will be a button to go to that site. These sites will open in a new tab.

                This page alone will also be designed to not change much during (pc browser) zooming and should support any device viewing it.

                The sites linked on this page may not be optimized for mobile use. This was not a requirement for them at the time of making them. However, they may be updated for this in the future.

                        This site was made for one of my Aunt's birthdays. It was made without much css and no javascript. So nothing much fancy here.

                        This was the first assignment from my Web Design 2 class at OTC.

                    <div class="siteDesc" id="siteDesc" tabindex="-1">
                        This was my first handle on javascript in my Web Design 2 class for OTC. All it does is handle image clicking and swapping very basically.
                        <br>
                        Images may be slow to load as they are a high resolution.
                        <li class="goToSiteBtn" id="goToSiteBtn">Go to site</li>

                    <div class="siteDesc" id="siteDesc" tabindex="-1">
                        In this site I learned how to handle forms. This includes retrieving data, saving it as a variable, then displaying it on screen.
                        <br>
                        It uses a Bootstrap template as a guide.
                        <li class="goToSiteBtn" id="goToSiteBtn">Go to site</li>

                    <div class="siteDesc" id="siteDesc" tabindex="-1">
                        This site is similar to the Image Swapping site above. However all javascript is ran through functions in this site.
                        <br>
                        Again, images may be slow to load.
                        <li class="goToSiteBtn" id="goToSiteBtn">Go to site</li>

                    <div class="siteDesc" id="siteDesc" tabindex="-1">
                        This is similar to the other two sites, however this one runs through functions and arrays. Adding image links to the array automatically adds the images to the site.
                        <br>
                        Again, images may be slow to load.

                    <div class="siteDesc" id="siteDesc" tabindex="-1">
                        This site uses all of the knowledge from the previous sites to create a form with various inputs. These inputs are recorded and returned to the user when the user submits their order.
                        <br>
                        This site was inspired from the Subscribe To My Website site. However uses no template.
